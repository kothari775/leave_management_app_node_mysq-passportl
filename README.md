# Small Leave Management Application with Node.js, Mysql, Passport (Authentication)

## Instructions

If you would like to download the code and try it for yourself:

+ Install packages: `npm install` (package.json default)
+ Also need one more 'npm install dojo' (ext. library for finding difference in terms of days, years, etc. format between 2 given date)
+ Edit the database configuration: `config/database.js`
+ Take readymade scripts for existing records : `node scripts/leave_app.sql`
+ Launch: `node server.js`
+ Visit in your browser at: `http://localhost:8082/login`

Incomplete things or things not worked somehow after trying too hard till 5 AM in morning, so leaving as its gonna affect my tomorrow performance. But yes honestly I didn't know how node.js Login, Mysql DB connection and CRUD operation works so I took help and find few readymade stuff from google, github which makes most of the things better.

+ Emplyee login working now i.e. user.user_type = 1. Manager Login and approve leave module functionality is not done.
+ One more thing like employee leave app form submissions stop working somehow and that wasted my most of the time.
